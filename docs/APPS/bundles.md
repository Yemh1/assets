# :briefcase: Shared Technology Bundles and Libraries

Most of the developments inside the BreatheCode's assets share the same stack of technologies and libraries (React.js, jQuery, etc.). That is why we decided to create a small libraries or bundles to re-use in different developments.

## React projects have this vendor bundles available for use:
